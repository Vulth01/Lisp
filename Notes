From what I have encountered, here are some notes that could hopefully help:

- Loading up the project, I have to launch Portable Common Lisp IDE (Portacle) and not GNU Emacs

- Make a file, open it.

- Top half is the code and bottom half is command console, or whatever the terminology is supposed to be.

- For setting up the project according to your taste, use Ctrl-0/1/2/3. Refer to the cheatsheet.

- Navigate between buffers with Ctrl-o. Navigate the content of the buffer with Ctrl-x + < or >

- C-x is Ctrl-X / M-x is Alt-x


- Syntax is weird... Here is an example:
              (defune Square (x) 
                (* x x))
              (defun doThing (x) 
                (Square x))

              CL-USER> (doThing 5)   ->   25

- Code not working? Try saving with C-x C-s and evaluating the entire buffer with "M-x eval-buffer", or C-x C-e to evaluate each function individually.
